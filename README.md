# GotOpportunity
                                         Connecting Companies with Students and Employees 
 
### About the Project
GotOpportunity is a **Job Finding/Providing App** that connects companies with probable future employees (initially it is specialized for programmers). The main goal of this App is to match properly the needs of the company that is providing a Job Offer with the skills that Programmers who are enrolled in the system have. 
Each Programmer who is apllying for a Job, holds his/her own score depending on his/her education level and the abilities that Company needs and he/she can offer.

This is a Team Project that was developed by a small group of (2nd year) students in the University of Macedonia (UoM) within the framework of the course "Software Technology - Software Engineering".
